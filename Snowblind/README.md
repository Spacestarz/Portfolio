* I made the interaction promt
* Made so the player is able to pick up and down items.
* In the inventory squares you can also see how many you have in each inventory slot.

<strong> Save System: </strong>
* I save so when the player pick up an item that it wont be in the world again if they die or quit the game. Same if they drop an item it will be in the same spot where they left it.
* I made more smaller save like if they have seen the tutorials they wont show up again also the intro texts if they have already seen it they wont see it again.

<strong> Checkpoint </strong>
* Made a checkpoint system for the player when they sleep in a tent. So if they quit the game(or die ingame) i save so they will spawn in the tent.
