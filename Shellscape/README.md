# My contribution to Shellscape

Shellscape is a aquatic fps hack n slash hybrid in a aquatic setting. Where you will need to take the boss Joe Mantis.
You will need to beware of your surrounding and take down Joe Mantis as fast as possible to get in the high score list. 

I also got the privilege to be the team leader of this project. 

I also had a big role as a everyman and contributed all around.

# Sea urchins & Spikes

When we made the boss fight we realized that a lot of people just stood in place and didn't need to move at all. So we added Sea urchins and spikes that spawn and so the player need to move and also beware of their surrounding while fighting the boss
- I made the sea urching spawn, player take damage and that the sea urching will disappear so it wont be sea urchin over the whole arena after while.
- Made the spikes spawn from the ground.
  Spikes will spawn in a area around the player and if the player won't move out of the area a spike will come up from the ground and damage the player.

# High Score
When the player starts the game a timer starts and ends when the player has defeated the boss. If the player is in the top 5 they can write their name and it will end up in the high score list in the menu.

I also helped a lot in other script where everyone contributed. 
I was a bit of everywhere. 

I also started and made a few attacks for the second boss but we realized that we wouldn't have time to implement it.
