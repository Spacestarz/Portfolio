#My contribution to Shellscape


Helped with the harpoon shooting (many have been in that script)

When harpoon detects collision stays(many have been in that script)

Made sea urchin spawn when boss make shockwave. Also that player take damage from the urchin, and disappear when collision with player

Made crowd projectile which then turned into spike thing. Spawn in a area around the player and after while the player take damage.
