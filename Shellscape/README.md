# High Score
When the player starts the game a timer starts and ends when the player has defeated the boss. If the player is in the top 5 they can write their name and it will end up in the high score list in the menu. 

# Other

I also helped a lot in other script where everyone contributed. 
I helped a lot in the harpoon shooting, harpoon detect collision and a bit of everything

I also started and made a few attacks for the second boss but we realized that we wouldn't have time to implement it.
